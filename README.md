# P7 Credit Scoring API with Flask

## Project Overview

This API is a part of the OpenClassrooms Data Scientist program (Project #7) developed for the financial company "Prêt à dépenser." The primary goal of this API is to serve predictions from the credit scoring model implemented in the OpenClassrooms project. The model calculates the probability of a customer repaying their loan, aiding in the classification of loan applications as either approved or denied. The algorithm utilizes diverse data sources, including behavioral data and information from other financial institutions.

## API Functionality

The API consists of two main functionalities:

1. **Prediction Endpoint:**
   - The API provides a prediction endpoint where clients can submit their data to receive a prediction on whether their loan application will be approved or denied.

2. **Explanatory Endpoint:**
   - Upon receiving a prediction, clients can use the explanatory endpoint to gain insights into the factors influencing the credit decision. This utilizes the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library to generate a waterfall plot explaining the model's decision.

## How to Use the API

### Prediction Endpoint

- **Endpoint:** `/predict`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Format:** JSON
- **Request Payload:** Include the necessary client data for prediction.
  
  ```json
  {
    "feature1": value1,
    "feature2": value2,
    ...
  }
  ```

- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Response Payload:** A response indicating whether the loan is predicted to be approved or denied.

  ```json
  {
    "prediction": "approved" | "denied"
  }
  ```

### Explanatory Endpoint

- **Endpoint:** `/explain`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Format:** JSON
- **Request Payload:** Include the necessary client data for which you want an explanation.
  
  ```json
  {
    "feature1": value1,
    "feature2": value2,
    ...
  }
  ```

- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Response Payload:** A response containing the SHAP values and data needed to generate a waterfall plot.

  ```json
  {
    "shap_values": [shap_value1, shap_value2, ...],
    "base_value": base_value,
    "features": ["feature1", "feature2", ...]
  }
  ```

## Running the API Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itwasmil/API.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the API:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
